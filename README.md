this was a tutorial project to build a very simple login module.
to run:

1. npm install all dependencies in the package.json: dotenv, express, express-session, mysql, nodemon
2. make sure you write a config.env file and use dotenv to assign values to the variables: MYSQL_PASSWORD and PORT
3. open your terminal and run the script: npm start
